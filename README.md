## Hello there - I am Nihar👋
🚀I am a final year undergraduate student pursuing a degree in computer science. I have developed a knack for problem-solving and possess a strong foundation in various computer science concepts. These include data structures and algorithms, object-oriented system design, database management systems, operating systems, and computer networks.

🚀As a backend developer, my expertise lies in Golang and its associated frameworks. However, I firmly believe that programming languages merely serve as toolkits, and I am always eager to embrace new challenges by learning and contributing in different languages.

🚀Apart from my backend development skills, I am also deeply interested in blockchain technology. In the past, I have gained experience working in non-technical roles within the web3 ecosystem.











🧠 I'm currently learning
Low and high level system architecture of software applications and Golang(Gin).

⚡️ Fun fact I have a pet tortoise🐢


## 🛠 Skills

I consider myself a bit old school as I still prefer coding in C++!
